1.A list is a collection of elements. These elements may be homogeneous or heterogeneous.

2.A list is a value that contains multiple values in an ordered sequence. The term list value refers to the
   list itself (which is a value that can be stored in a variable or passed to a function like any other value)
   
3.Just as string values are typed with quote characters to mark where the string begins and ends, a list 
   begins with an opening square bracket and ends with a closing square bracket, [].
   
4.Values inside the list are also called items. Items are separated with commas (that is, they are comma-
   delimited).

5.A list also allows duplicate elements.

6.Insertion order is preserved in list.

7.List elements are separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]).

8.Every element in the list has its own unique index number.

9.List supports both forward indexing and backward indexing, forward index starts from 0 and backward 
  index starts from -1.
  
10.We access either specific element by using indexing or set of elements by using slicing from the List.

11.We can create list in different ways. Like by using list() function, by using square brackets “[]” and also 
   by using range() function.
   
12.List objects are mutable.
